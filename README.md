# Multi-table-game
a game that test you on your times tables from 1-10


my daughter was struggling with her times tables so i threw together this little game to keep her more involved and so that she can get instant feed back on being right or wrong.

the game goes from a score of 0 with every correct answer getting a point and every incorrect answer deducting nothing but showing the correct answer.
